## Another Type of Loop

**Directions:**

Use the array's `forEach()`[method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) to loop over the following array and add 100 to each of the values if the value is divisible by `3`.

'var test = [12, 929, 11, 3, 199, 1000, 7, 1, 24, 37, 4, 19, 300, 3775, 299, 36, 209, 148, 169, 299, 6, 109, 20, 58, 139, 59, 3, 1, 139'
